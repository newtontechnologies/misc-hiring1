      All the instructions and requirements for the challenge are in 
      <a href="https://github.com/newtontechnologies/misc-hiring1">this GitHub repository</a>
    </p>

    <p>We estimate that the challenge will take you around 2 to 5 hours to complete depending
      on your experience level and how much time you want to invest in it.
    </p> 

    <p>
      Please track your time spent on the challenge and let us know how long it took you to complete it.
      We absolutely do not intend to judge the solution based on the time spent. Rather, we want to understand
      how long does it take to complete the challenge in general.
    </p>

    <p>
      After you submit your solution, we will provide you with a comprehensive review so that you have
      a proper feedback on your work.
